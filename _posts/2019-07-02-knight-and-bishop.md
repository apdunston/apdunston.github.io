title: Knight and Bishop

---

When I put together a talk, I generally use a central metaphor. When [@jennydoesthings](https://twitter.com/jennydoesthings) writes a talk, she generally uses pictures of her cates. For our talk ["The Deal: Quality and Development Together"](https://speakerdeck.com/apdunston/the-deal-quality-and-development-together), we chose BOTH. We decided on using a chess knight and bishop (two pieces that are very different but work well together) to represent QA and dev.

Jenny and her cats, Dax and Dante had a photo shoot with chess pieces. My daughter and I decided to make a photo project of it. So here I present to you Adrian and Hero Dunston's phototography project: "Knight and Bishop"
