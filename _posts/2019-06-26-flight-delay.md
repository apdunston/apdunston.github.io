title: Flight Delay

Heading to Chicago to speak at [Agile Testing Days USA](https://agiletestingdays.us/), [@jennydoesthings](https://twitter.com/jennydoesthings) and I were lined up to board a plane. We got an announcement that our plane had struck a bird, and we'd need a new plane. With a couple of hours' wait, I made a game to commemorate the occasion.

I hereby present [FLIGHT DELAY](/public/downloads/pico-8/flight_delay/flight_delay.html)!
