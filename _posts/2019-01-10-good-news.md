title: Good News This Week
---

Two great pieces of news this week! First, I got word that my TestBash talk in November made [their top ten list for the year](https://ministryoftesting.com/news/top-ten-testbash-talks-2018)!

Second, I was informed that [Jenny Bramble](https://twitter.com/jennydoesthings) and I have been accepted to give a talk at Agile Testing Days in Chicago in June!

I feel honored and excited about both things.
