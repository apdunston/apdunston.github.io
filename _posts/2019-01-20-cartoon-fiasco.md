TL;DR - [Cartoon Fiasco Playset](/public/downloads/Cartoon%20Fiasco.pdf)

Soon-to-be 11yo daughter wants to do a role playing game for her birthday party. One of her friends doesn't play a role playing games. There's a cooperative storytelling game called [Fiasco](http://bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/). I made up a little cartoon setting for it. Today I played cartoon fiasco with daughter and soon-to-be 14yo son. I was worried that they would not understand it, or be bored or be upset. It's mostly a game about terrible things happening to cartoon characters, and while that's hilarious in cartoons, I could see it being less funny when it's "your" character.

In our story, the climax was a brawl between an Minion-styled race-car, its Monster truck ex-girlfriend, an evil genius motorcycle bent on revenge, and a thieving anime vampire desperate to pay off the race-car's medical bills.

They loved it! Really knocked it out of the park with this experience. So pleased.
